heading - it will introduce users to the page
img - that shows us and a form of visual appeal
sections that explain different things about us
links for people to reach out to us.

Examples of inline-block elements i.e elements that sits beside each other:
- the a tag
- img tag
- button
- span

Example of block elements i.e elements that stack on top of each other:
- p
- div
- headings i.e h1 through h6
- list

To change an inline-block element to block element i.e to change element sitting beside each other to stacking on top of each other, we use the following css code:

selector {
    display: block;
}

on the other hand, to change a block element to inline-block element i.e to change element stacking on top of each other to sit beside each other, we use the following css code:

selector {
    display: inline-block;
}


-----------------List----------------
In HTML there are two types of lists:
- Unordered List with the tag <ul>
Unodered list are unnumbered and follow no specific order

- Ordered List with the tag <ol>
Ordered list on the other hand are ordered i.e they follow a logical pattern that are arranged in a numbered or alphabetical manner

Rule: when handling list, only a list item can be directly inside a list whether ordered or unordered
when using a list, we specify the list items with the tag <li>

----------------- Tables -------------------
There are four parts to every tables:
- <tables>: This is the outermost part of the table definition i.e this is what wraps around everything else for the table.
______________________________________
- <tr>: This translates to "table row". every line in a table is a row, hence every element or data in a row are all enclosed in the tr tag.
_______________________________________
- <th>: This is a semantic element that tells assistive technology that this is the heading of our table. It also stands out visually more than the other elemend/data in the table.
_______________________________________
- <td>: This stands for the data in the table hence refered to as the table data. While building a table every other element that are not the heading are refered to as the table data.
