heading - it will introduce users to the page
img - that shows us and a form of visual appeal
sections that explain different things about us
links for people to reach out to us.

Examples of inline-block elements i.e elements that sits beside each other:
- the a tag
- img tag
- button
- span

Example of block elements i.e elements that stack on top of each other:
- p
- div
- headings i.e h1 through h6
- list

To change an inline-block element to block element i.e to change element sitting beside each other to stacking on top of each other, we use the following css code:

selector {
    display: block;
}

on the other hand, to change a block element to inline-block element i.e to change element stacking on top of each other to sit beside each other, we use the following css code:

selector {
    display: inline-block;
}


-----------------List----------------
In HTML there are two types of lists:
- Unordered List with the tag <ul>
Unodered list are unnumbered and follow no specific order

- Ordered List with the tag <ol>
Ordered list on the other hand are ordered i.e they follow a logical pattern that are arranged in a numbered or alphabetical manner

Rule: when handling list, only a list item can be directly inside a list whether ordered or unordered
when using a list, we specify the list items with the tag <li>

----------------- Tables -------------------
There are four parts to every tables:
- <tables>: This is the outermost part of the table definition i.e this is what wraps around everything else for the table.
______________________________________
- <tr>: This translates to "table row". every line in a table is a row, hence every element or data in a row are all enclosed in the tr tag.
_______________________________________
- <th>: This is a semantic element that tells assistive technology that this is the heading of our table. It also stands out visually more than the other elemend/data in the table.
_______________________________________
- <td>: This stands for the data in the table hence refered to as the table data. While building a table every other element that are not the heading are refered to as the table data.

--------------------- semantic HTML --------------------
This refers to an HTML tag that has a meaningful usage to the computer, crawlers, and assistive technology. it help group the html structure meaningfully.
The popular semantic HTMLs includes:
- header <header>
- navigations <nav>
- sections <section>
- articles <article>
- aside <aside>
- figure <figure>
- figcaption <figcaption>
- footer <footer>
- time <time>
- address <addr>
- table <table>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
- list <list>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
- main <main>

-------------------CSS------------------------
There are 3 methods of writing a CSS for your HTML project:
1. Inline CSS: This is written directly inside the html tag of the element we want to style. e.g:
    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;">Hello World</p>

2. Internal CSS: an internal CSS is written in the head section of an HTML file. The CSS is enclosed within the style tag. e.g:
    <style>
        p {
            background-color: red;
            font-size: 20px
        }

        div {
            border: 1px;
            background-color: yellow;
        }
    </style>

3. External CSS: This is an advance CSS writing style, where the CSS for an HTML project is written in another file entirely for clean organizaton and ease of debugging.

the format for styling an HTML entity is:
    selector {
        property: value;
        property: value;
    }

A selector is a naming convention for styling an HTML entity. There are 3 types of selectors:
1. Type selector
    A type selector uses the html tag directly to target an html entity for styling. e.g p, div, a, header, span, img, input...
        div {
            property: value;
        }

2. Class selector
    A class helps us group html entities to style for a focused styling regardless of the tag frequency. To use the class selector to target an html entity in css, we precede the class name with a dot. e.g suppose we have an html entity with the class name insider, to style it in css, we say:
        .insider {
            property: value;
        }
